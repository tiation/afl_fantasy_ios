players = [5 basic players with 7 properties]

// Available but unused: Comprehensive data
- 300+ properties per player
- Venue performance analysis
- Injury risk modeling  
- Seasonal trends
- Weather impact data
```

#### 2. **Captain Advisor Enhancement** 
```swift
// Current: Static confidence %
confidence: 92, projectedPoints: 260

## üí° **Quick Wins to Show Advanced Features**

### **Immediate (1-2 hours)**
```swift
// 1. Show comprehensive player data in cards
Text("Consistency: \(player.consistencyGrade)")
Text("Injury Risk: \(player.injuryRisk.riskLevel.rawValue)")
Text("Venue Bias: \(player.venuePerformance.first?.bias ?? 0)")

// 2. Enhanced Captain analysis display
VStack {
    Text("Venue Impact: \(suggestion.analysis.venueImpact)")
    Text("Opponent Matchup: \(suggestion.analysis.opponentMatchup)")
    Text("Form Factor: \(suggestion.analysis.recentForm)")
}

// 3. Add alert count badge
TabView {
    AlertCenterView()
        .badge(alertService.activeAlerts.count)
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current User Experience Issue**

**Users see a basic AFL Fantasy app** with:
- Simple player cards
- Basic captain suggestions  
- Non-functional trade calculator
- Minimal cash cow analysis

**But we have built a sophisticated AI-powered platform** with:
- Advanced multi-factor analysis algorithms
- Comprehensive risk assessment
- Intelligent alert system
- Professional-grade analytics suite

**The gap between backend capability and UI presentation is 85%**

---

## üéØ **Recommendation**

**PRIORITY 1:** Connect existing backend services to UI immediately
**PRIORITY 2:** Create dedicated screens for advanced analytics
**PRIORITY 3:** Implement interactive features and real data

**With just 1-2 weeks of UI integration work, we can showcase the full power of our sophisticated AFL Fantasy intelligence platform!** üöÄ
