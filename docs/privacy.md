**Key principle:** We do not collect, store, or share your personal information online. All data processing happens locally on your device.

- All processing happens locally on your device
- We have no servers storing your data
- We have no advertising or analytics partners
- We don't use third-party tracking services

## 5. Data Security

While we don't collect personal data, we protect the local data on your device through:

- **Device keychain storage** for sensitive app preferences
- **Encryption at rest** for locally cached data
- **Secure network connections** (HTTPS) when downloading public AFL data
- **Regular security updates** following Apple's security guidelines

## 6. Third-Party Services

### AFL Data Sources

### Apple Services

We may use Apple's built-in services like:
- **Sign in with Apple** (optional, for future features)
- **App Store** for app distribution
- **iOS system features** (notifications, settings)

These services have their own privacy policies and data handling practices.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Our app is rated 12+ in the App Store. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we don't collect personal information at all, this policy applies universally.

## 8. International Users

Our app works globally, but:
- All data processing is local to your device

- Legal or regulatory requirements
- New app features

When we make changes:
