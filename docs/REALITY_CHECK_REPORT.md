## üì± iOS App Current State

### What Works ‚úÖ
- **Dashboard UI** - Beautiful, HIG-compliant interface
- **Mock Data Flow** - Simulated team scores, player stats, AI insights
- **Navigation** - Tab-based architecture with proper iOS patterns
- **Performance** - Sub-1.8s cold start, 60fps animations
- **Accessibility** - Full VoiceOver support, dynamic type scaling
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error states and recovery

### What's Missing ‚ùå
- **Real API Integration** - All data is hardcoded mock responses
- **Live Updates** - No real-time score streaming
- **Authentication** - No secure login to AFL Fantasy accounts
- **Push Notifications** - No alert system implementation
- **Advanced Views** - Many promised screens are "Coming Soon" placeholders

## üîß Backend Services Status

### What Exists ‚úÖ
- **Flask APIs** - Captain, Cash, Risk, Trade analysis endpoints
- **TypeScript Tools** - Price prediction, trade scoring, AI insights
- **Python Scrapers** - AFL.com, Footywire, DraftStars data collection
- **Data Processing** - Player stats, fixture data, price tracking

### Integration Issues ‚ùå
- **No Docker Compose** - Services don't start together
- **No Database Schema** - Scraped data not stored in structured format
- **No Real-time Streaming** - No WebSocket/SSE for live updates
- **No Authentication** - No user session management
- **No API Gateway** - Direct Flask endpoints, not production-ready

## üíä Hard Truth Assessment

### What You Can Demo Today
1. **Beautiful iOS App** - Screenshot-ready interface that looks professional
2. **Mock AI Insights** - Fake but realistic captain suggestions and trade analysis
3. **Basic Navigation** - Users can navigate between different sections
4. **Individual Backend Services** - Each API works in isolation

### What You Can't Demo Today
1. **End-to-End User Flow** - Login ‚Üí Live Scores ‚Üí AI Suggestions ‚Üí Execute Trade
2. **Real-time Updates** - Scores don't actually update during games
3. **Data-Driven Insights** - All AI recommendations are hardcoded
4. **Cross-Platform Sync** - No user data persistence or sync
5. **Production Readiness** - No deployment pipeline or monitoring

**Focus**: Get core live data + basic AI working in 4-6 weeks
- Real dashboard with live scores
- Simple captain advisor (rule-based)
- Basic price drop alerts
- One working trade suggestion flow

### Option B: Full Implementation
**Focus**: Complete the entire spec in 12-15 weeks
- All advanced features implemented
- Production-ready deployment
- Full AI/ML capabilities

### Option C: Demo-First Approach
**Focus**: Polish the UI for investment/user testing
- Perfect the mock experience
- Add more realistic fake data
