### 🔧 Remaining Build Issues

1. **Missing Model Types**
   - `FantasyTeam` type is not defined
   - `TeamManager.error` property is missing
   
2. **Import Statements**
   - Some files may need import path updates after reorganization

3. **Xcode Project**
   - Project file needs to be synchronized with new file structure

### 📋 Next Steps

1. Define missing model types (`FantasyTeam`, etc.)
2. Add missing properties to `TeamManager`
3. Update import statements throughout the codebase
4. Rebuild Xcode project references
5. Run comprehensive build test
6. Set up unit test infrastructure
7. Create architecture documentation

### 🎯 Achievement Summary

- **0 duplicate files** remaining (down from 6)
- **Clean directory structure** with no duplicate folders
- **Proper separation** of Views/ViewModels in Features
- **Consolidated services** in Core
- **Build configuration** properly set up
