Got it! Below is the detailed prompt for Replit Agent based on your specifications, now including **DVP line graph** for player/team match-up difficulty and **player roles** in the top table, with additional category breaks for reducing clutter. Let's make sure to include all the details you‚Äôve requested:

---

### **Project Overview for Replit Agent**

#### **AFL Fantasy Stats Dashboard - Enhanced Version**

This dashboard will display a variety of AFL Fantasy stats and visualizations in a clear, mobile-optimized interface with enhanced interactivity and customization. Key updates include the addition of **DVP Line Graph**, **Player Roles**, and better organization of the top table to reduce clutter.

---

### **1. Top Stats Table (Collapsible Categories & Role Data)**

The table should be scrollable both horizontally and vertically. It will display detailed stats for each player, organized into clearly labeled categories. These categories can be **expanded or collapsed** based on user selection.

#### **First Column (Sticky & Stacked)**:

This first column should be sticky across all tables and visible when scrolling. The data in this column should be stacked vertically, with no header to minimize clutter:

* **Player Name (First & Last)**
* **Price**
* **Team**
* **Position**
* **Games Played**
* **Role** (Player's fantasy role: e.g., Midfield, Forward, Defender)

---

#### **Categories for Stats Table**:

1. **Basic Stats** (Include for each player):

   * **Average (L3, L5, L10, and Season)**
   * **Break-Even (BE)**
   * **Points per \$ Index (PP\$)**
   * **Total Points Scored**
   * **Points per Minute (PPM)**
   * **Kick-In %**
   * **CBA %**
   * **Contested Marks**
   * **Uncontested Marks**

3. **Player Value/Consistency**:

   * **Consistency Rating**: A transparent line graph showing performance volatility for the last 5 rounds.
   * **Points per \$ Index**: A visual bar-style indicator for comparing value at a glance.

4. **Matchup Difficulty (DVP)**:

   * **Line Graph**: Display a **DVP line graph** showing the player/team matchup difficulty for the next 5 rounds for various player positions (Midfield, Forward, Defender, Ruck).
   * The **DVP line graph** should be toggleable between **Player-based** and **Team-based** views, displaying difficulty levels for both player positions and teams.

---

### **2. Interactive Heat Maps**

#### **Heat Map Options**:

* **Player Heat Map**: Toggleable between contested and uncontested disposals.

  * **Contested Disposals**: Dark purple color for contested disposals, darkening based on the number of disposals in that region.
  * **Uncontested Disposals**: Light blue to dark blue for uncontested disposals, darkening as the number of disposals increases.

* **Team Heat Map**: A team-based heat map with similar features for displaying contested/uncontested disposals across the field.

#### **Tabs for Heat Map and Search**:

* **Search Bar 1: Player Selection**: A search bar where users can type the player‚Äôs name, and the system suggests players after typing two letters (even with small spelling mistakes).
* **Search Bar 2: Team Selection**: A dropdown menu showing all 18 AFL teams for the user to select.
* **Tab 3: Disposals Type**: Users can toggle between **Contested/Uncontested Disposals**, which will switch the heat map to show either player disposals or team disposals.

### **3. Points per \$ Index Transparent Line Graph**

The **Points per \$ Index** will be shown as a transparent line graph with a gradient scale. This will allow users to quickly compare the value of players.

---

### **4. Player Matchup Difficulty (DVP) Line Graph**

Display a **DVP line graph** showing the matchup difficulty for each player in the next 5 rounds. This should be color-coded by **position** (Midfield, Forward, Defender, Ruck), and users should be able to toggle between viewing **Player-based** or **Team-based** DVP data.

---

### **5. Interactivity & Usability Features**

#### **Round Display**:

When the user clicks on a round (e.g., Round 8), a small box will pop up displaying the exact projected score, BE, and price change for that round.

#### **Dropdown Filter**

The top section will have a **dropdown filter** for sorting by:

* Team
* Position
* Price
* Break-Even
* Form
* Role (e.g., Mid, Forward, etc.)

#### **Color Themes**

Each stat will be color-coded for clarity:

* **Red** = Very Bad
* **Orange** = Bad
* **Light Green** = Good
* **Dark Green** = Very Good
* **White** = Neutral
* **Blue** = Bye

Icons (üìà, ü©π, üî•) will be used for easy mobile readability.

---

### **6. Consistency & Volatility Indicators**

Include a **consistency rating** section showing the **last 5 rounds** of a player‚Äôs score volatility. This will be displayed as a **transparent line graph** for score consistency, where:

* **Tag**: ‚Äúüîí Reliable‚Äù / ‚Äúüé≤ Risky‚Äù / ‚Äúüìà Rising‚Äù

---

### **7. Injury Report Section**

Display injury information for each player, including:

* **Current Status**: Whether the player is active or injured
* **Expected Return Date**: If applicable
* **Link to External Injury Source**: A clickable link to an external injury report (optional).

---

### **Next Steps**

1. **UI Layout**: Design the layout for the **collapsible categories** in the top table and **heat maps** with **search bar functionality** for players and teams.
2. **DVP Line Graph**: Implement the **DVP line graph** for player/team match-up difficulty in the next 5 rounds.
3. **Points per \$ Index**: Add the **Points per \$ Index** as a **transparent line graph**.
4. **Player Consistency Graph**: Design the **consistency/volatility graph** for each player.
5. **Scraping Integration**: After UI setup, integrate the necessary scraping logic for data fetching (player stats, DVP data, injury information, etc.).
6. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure the layout is fully optimized for mobile devices, ensuring all stats and graphs are displayed clearly.

This prompt should give Replit Agent clear, actionable steps to implement the new layout and features while adhering to the mobile optimization and interactivity goals. Let me know when you're ready to move forward!
