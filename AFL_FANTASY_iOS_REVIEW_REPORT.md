```swift
@MainActor
final class MasterDataService: ObservableObject {
    // Single source of truth for all data
    @Published var players: [Player] = []
    @Published var fixtures: [Fixture] = []
    @Published var teams: [Team] = []
    @Published var venues: [Venue] = []
    
    // AI Analysis Engines
    private let captainAnalyzer: CaptainAnalysisEngine
    private let tradeAnalyzer: TradeAnalysisEngine  
    private let cashCowAnalyzer: CashCowAnalysisEngine
    private let alertEngine: SmartAlertEngine
    
    // Custom Algorithm v3.4.4
    func generateProjections() -> [PlayerProjection] {
        // Implement proprietary projection algorithm
    }
}
```

#### **2. AIAnalysisService**
```swift
actor AIAnalysisService {
    func generateCaptainRecommendations(for round: Int) async -> [CaptainSuggestion]
    func analyzeTradeOpportunities(budget: Int) async -> [TradeRecommendation]
    func scanCashCowStatus() async -> [CashCowAnalysis]

```swift
final class RealTimeDataManager: ObservableObject {
    private let webSocketManager: WebSocketManager
    
    @Published var liveScores: [LiveScore] = []
    @Published var priceChanges: [PriceChange] = []
    @Published var injuryUpdates: [InjuryUpdate] = []
    
    func startLiveUpdates() async
    func handleRealTimeUpdate(_ update: DataUpdate)
}
```

### **Required Algorithm Implementations**

#### **Captain Confidence Algorithm v3.4.4**
```swift
func calculateCaptainConfidence(
    venueBias: Double,      // -10 to +10
    opponentDVP: Double,    // 1-18 difficulty
    formFactor: Double,     // 0.7-1.4 multiplier
    consistency: ConsistencyGrade,
    weatherImpact: Double,  // -0.3 to +0.1
    injuryRisk: Double      // 0-100%
) -> Int {
    let baseScore = 50.0
    let venueAdjustment = venueBias * 2.5
    let opponentAdjustment = (19 - opponentDVP) * 1.8
    let formAdjustment = (formFactor - 1.0) * 40
    let consistencyAdjustment = consistency.scoreAdjustment
    let weatherAdjustment = weatherImpact * 15
    let injuryAdjustment = -injuryRisk * 0.3
    
    let finalScore = baseScore + venueAdjustment + opponentAdjustment + 
                    formAdjustment + consistencyAdjustment + 
                    weatherAdjustment + injuryAdjustment
    
    return max(0, min(100, Int(finalScore)))
}
```

## 🏗️ **Standards Application**

### **Apply iOS Standards from Rules**

#### **1. Create .swiftformat in root**
```bash
# Apply HIG-aligned formatting

set -euo pipefail
swiftformat .
swiftlint
xcodebuild -scheme "AFL Fantasy" -sdk iphonesimulator \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' \
  -enableCodeCoverage YES test | xcpretty
bash Scripts/coverage_gate.sh 80
EOF

chmod +x Scripts/quality.sh
```

#### **3. Update .gitignore for iOS**
```gitignore
# iOS Build artifacts
DerivedData/
build/
xcuserdata/
*.xcuserstate
.build/
Packages/
*.xcworkspace
Secrets/*.plist

# Merge strategy
*.pbxproj merge=union
