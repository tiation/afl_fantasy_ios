# AFL Fantasy iOS Build Fixes Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the major build issues that were resolved to get the AFL Fantasy iOS project compiling successfully. The project had extensive duplicate type declarations, missing core types, and ambiguous references that prevented compilation.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Missing Core Types
**Problem**: The codebase referenced many core types that were not defined anywhere, causing "cannot find type" errors.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive shared types in `AFLFantasy/Models/Shared/SharedTypes.swift`:
- `TabItem` enum with title and systemImage properties
- `InjuryRisk` and related enums (`InjuryRiskLevel`)
- Player projection types (`RoundProjection`, `SeasonProjection`, `VenuePerformance`)
- Alert and analysis types (`AlertFlag`, `AlertType`, `FixtureAnalysis`)
- Weather and recommendation types (`WeatherConditions`, `RecommendationPriority`)
- Trading types (`TradeAnalysisResult`, `CashCowAnalysis`, `SellWindow`)
- Supporting types (`CaptainData`, `TradeRecord`, `CachedDataEntity`)

### 2. ✅ AFLHapticsManager Initialization
**Problem**: `AFLHapticsManager` had a private initializer, preventing direct instantiation.

**Solution**: 
- Changed `private init()` to `public init()` in `AFLHapticsManager.swift`
- Added missing `onPositionSelect()` method referenced by UI components

### 3. ✅ Network Type Ambiguities
**Problem**: Multiple declarations of `NetworkError`, `HTTPMethod`, and `APIEndpoint` across different files.

**Solution**: 
- Consolidated all networking types into `AFLFantasy/Models/Shared/NetworkModels.swift`
- Removed duplicate files (`AFLFantasy/Networking/NetworkError.swift`, `AFLFantasy/Networking/APIEndpoint.swift`)
- Created comprehensive `NetworkError` enum with proper error descriptions and retry logic
- Defined public `HTTPMethod` enum and `APIEndpoint` protocol with default implementations

### 4. ✅ Duplicate Type Declarations
**Problem**: Multiple definitions of core types like `DashboardData`, `AFLTeam`, `TradeAnalysis`, etc.

**Solution**: 
- Removed duplicate `DashboardData` from `AFLFantasy/Models/CoreModels.swift` and `AFLFantasy/UseCases/GetDashboardDataUseCase.swift`
- Deleted entire `AFLFantasy/Models/CoreModels.swift` file as it contained only duplicates
- Kept the comprehensive version in `AFLFantasy/Models/Shared/DashboardTypes.swift`

### 5. ✅ AppState Ambiguities  
**Problem**: Multiple `AppState` classes with different properties and purposes.

**Solution**: 
- Consolidated into single comprehensive `AppState` class in `AFLFantasy/Models/MissingTypes.swift`
- Enhanced with authentication, network status, error handling, and player management
- Removed duplicate from `AFLFantasy/Services/ServiceTypes.swift`
- Added supporting types (`User`, `NetworkStatus`, `LiveScores`)
- Maintained `LiveAppState` as a subclass for real-time updates

### 6. ✅ Protocol Conformance Issues
**Problem**: Conflicting protocol declarations with the same names but different signatures.

**Solution**: 
- Renamed protocols in `AFLFantasy/Services/ServiceProtocols.swift` to avoid naming conflicts:
  - `AFLFantasyScraperServiceProtocol` → `GameStateProtocol`
  - `KeychainService` → `SecureStorageProtocol` 
  - `DataSyncManager` → `AutoSyncProtocol`
  - `AFLFantasyDataServiceProtocol` → `DashboardServiceProtocol`

## Current Build Status

After these fixes, the build has progressed significantly:
- ✅ All major type ambiguity errors resolved
- ✅ Missing core types provided
- ✅ Initialization issues fixed
- ✅ Protocol conflicts resolved
- ✅ Network type consolidation complete

**Remaining Issues**: The current errors are primarily missing UI components (`AFLButton`) and method references (`onTabChange`, `onTradeComplete`), which are much simpler to fix than the fundamental type system issues that were resolved.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
- `AFLFantasy/Models/Shared/SharedTypes.swift` - Comprehensive missing types
- `AFLFantasy/Models/Shared/NetworkModels.swift` - Consolidated networking types

### Files Modified:
- `AFLFantasy/Core/DesignSystem/AFLHapticsManager.swift` - Made public, added missing methods
- `AFLFantasy/AFLFantasyApp.swift` - Removed duplicate TabItem extension
- `AFLFantasy/Models/MissingTypes.swift` - Enhanced AppState with full functionality
- `AFLFantasy/Services/ServiceTypes.swift` - Removed duplicate AppState
- `AFLFantasy/Services/ServiceProtocols.swift` - Renamed conflicting protocols
- `AFLFantasy/UseCases/GetDashboardDataUseCase.swift` - Removed duplicate DashboardData

### Files Removed:
- `AFLFantasy/Models/CoreModels.swift` - Contained only duplicates
- `AFLFantasy/Networking/NetworkError.swift` - Consolidated into NetworkModels
- `AFLFantasy/Networking/APIEndpoint.swift` - Consolidated into NetworkModels

## Next Steps

The remaining build errors are related to:
1. Missing UI components (can be created as needed)
2. Method references that need to be added to existing classes
3. Import statements that may need adjustment

The core architecture and type system is now stable and ready for continued development.
