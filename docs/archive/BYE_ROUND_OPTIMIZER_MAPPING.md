# Bye Round Optimizer Data Mapping

## Component: Bye Round Optimizer
**Location**: `client/src/components/tools/context/bye-round-optimizer.tsx`

## Data Requirements

### API Integration
- **Service Call**: `fetchByeOptimizer()` from contextService
- **Backend Endpoint**: `/api/context/bye-optimizer`
- **Method**: GET
- **Response Format**: JSON with bye round distribution data

### Input Data Structure
```typescript
type ByeRoundData = {
  round: string;           // Bye round identifier (e.g., "Round 12")
  player_count: number;    // Number of team players with bye this round
  risk_level: "High" | "Medium" | "Low"; // Risk assessment for team coverage
}
```

### Required Authentic Data Sources

#### AFL Fixture Data
- **Official Bye Schedule**: AFL season bye round allocations by team
- **Round Scheduling**: Accurate bye round timing and distribution
- **Team Allocations**: Which teams have byes in which rounds
- **Source**: Official AFL fixture data

#### User Team Composition
- **Player Team Affiliations**: Each player's AFL team for bye determination
- **Complete Squad**: All 26 players to assess full bye impact
- **Position Distribution**: How byes affect each position (DEF/MID/RUC/FWD)
- **Source**: User's authenticated AFL Fantasy team data

#### Coverage Analysis
- **Emergency Players**: Bench players available during bye rounds
- **Position Coverage**: Adequate replacements for each position
- **Scoring Impact**: Expected score reduction during heavy bye rounds
- **Source**: Team composition analysis algorithms

### Risk Assessment Logic

#### Risk Level Calculation
1. **High Risk**: 6+ players with byes (significant team disruption)
2. **Medium Risk**: 3-5 players with byes (moderate impact)
3. **Low Risk**: 0-2 players with byes (minimal disruption)

#### Factors in Risk Assessment
- **Player Count**: Total number of players affected
- **Position Impact**: Critical positions (captain, premium players)
- **Bench Coverage**: Availability of suitable replacements
- **Scoring Potential**: Expected point reduction during bye

### Missing Data Elements

2. **Position-Specific Impact**: Detailed breakdown by DEF/MID/RUC/FWD
3. **Emergency Coverage**: Bench player capabilities and scoring potential
4. **Historical Performance**: Past bye round team performance patterns

#### Authentication Requirements
- **AFL Fantasy Access**: Complete user team composition
- **Fixture Data**: Official AFL bye round scheduling
- **Player Database**: Team affiliations and position eligibility

### Frontend Display Features
