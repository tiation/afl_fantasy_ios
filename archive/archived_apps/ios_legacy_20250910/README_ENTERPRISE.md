## 🛠 **Development Workflow**

### **One-Command Quality Check**
```bash
# Run comprehensive quality validation
./Scripts/quality.sh

# What it does:
🔧 SwiftFormat - Formats all Swift code consistently
🔍 SwiftLint - Validates code quality and complexity  
🧪 Unit Tests - Runs all tests with coverage enabled
📊 Coverage Gate - Ensures 80%+ code coverage
🏗️ Release Build - Validates production readiness
```

### **Performance Validation**
```bash
# Check performance budgets
./Scripts/performance_budget.sh

# Validates:
📦 App Size: ≤ 60MB IPA limit
🚀 Launch Time: ≤ 1.8s cold start target
💾 Memory Usage: ≤ 220MB steady state
⚡ Performance Guidelines: Smart caching, async operations
```

### **Local Development Setup**
```bash
# Easy one-command setup
./Scripts/setup_dev_env.sh

# Or install manually:
brew install swiftformat swiftlint
gem install xcpretty --user-install

# Run quality check before commits
./Scripts/quality.sh

# Optional: Set up pre-commit hook
cp Scripts/quality.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
