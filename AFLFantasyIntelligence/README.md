### 🎨 Design System & UX

#### ✅ HIG Compliance
- **44pt minimum hit targets** for accessibility
- **Dynamic Type** support up to XXL
- **VoiceOver** accessibility labels and hints
- **Reduce Motion** respecting animations
- **System colors** for light/dark mode support

#### ✅ AFL-Specific Features
- **Position color coding** (DEF/MID/RUC/FWD)
- **Real-time score tracking** with mock data structure
- **Price change visualization** with trend indicators
- **Team structure analysis** with salary cap breakdown

### 🔗 Backend Integration

#### ✅ Working API Connection
- **Flask API Server**: `api_server.py` (602 players loaded successfully)
- **Real Data**: DFS Australia Excel files parsed and served
- **Endpoints Implemented**:
  - `/health` - Server status
  - `/api/players` - Complete player list
  - `/api/stats/cash-cows` - Cash generation analysis
  - `/api/captain/suggestions` - AI captain recommendations

#### ✅ Network Layer
- **Async/await** based APIService
- **Automatic retries** with exponential backoff
- **Health monitoring** with status indicators
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Mock data fallbacks** for offline development

## 🚀 Current Status: **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

### ✅ What Works Right Now
1. **Backend API**: 602 real AFL players loaded and serving data
2. **iOS App**: Compiles and builds successfully 
3. **Navigation**: 5-tab interface with all major features
4. **Real Data**: Players list connects to live backend
5. **Cash Cows**: Live analysis from actual player statistics
6. **Design System**: Beautiful, accessible UI components
7. **Standards**: SwiftLint, SwiftFormat, and build quality gates
