                "reasoning": "While Clayton Oliver is a premium mid, his price point is high relative to his average score, and his scoring can be inconsistent.  Sam Docherty offers a significant price drop, providing valuable salary cap relief.  His average score is respectable, and defenders generally offer more scoring consistency than mids.

Defenders often provide a more stable scoring base, especially when considering salary cap management.",

Checking the bye rounds and the opposition for both Docherty and your remaining players is crucial.

                "reasoning": "Daicos is a high-scoring midfielder with higher ownership (65%), making him less of a differential captain. While his average is respectable (108), his ceiling might be slightly lower than Miller's, and his higher ownership means less potential points gained relative to the field. Matchup and Collingwood's overall game plan will be crucial factors in determining his score.",

                "reasoning": "Grundy's average (95) is lower than the other options, and his ruck position carries inherent volatility. While he can score big, he's also susceptible to lower scores if the ruck contest is dominated by the opposition.  His lower ownership (35%) makes him a riskier captaincy choice, despite the potential for a high-scoring game at the MCG.",

While a high-ceiling player with low ownership can be tempting, the risk of a low score can significantly impact your overall rank.  Matchup analysis is crucial before finalizing your captain choice.  Consider the opposition's defensive strength and the overall game style of both teams.",
            "differential_options": "Consider exploring other midfielders with lower ownership but strong form and favorable matchups.  Look for players with a recent history of high scores, even if their average is slightly lower than the top options.  This requires more research into individual player form and opponent analysis."
