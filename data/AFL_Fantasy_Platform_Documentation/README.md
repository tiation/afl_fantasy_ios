# AFL Fantasy Intelligence Platform Documentation

## Overview
This documentation package contains everything needed to understand and complete the AFL Fantasy Intelligence Platform developed by **Tiation** following enterprise-grade DevOps best practices. The platform is 95% complete with core functionality working - remaining issues are primarily frontend data binding problems.

## Tiation DevOps Standards
This platform adheres to **Tiation's** enterprise-grade development standards:
- **Documentation Excellence**: Comprehensive technical documentation with regular updates
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing and validation procedures
- **Security First**: Secure coding practices and data protection measures
- **Deployment Automation**: CI/CD pipeline integration for reliable deployments
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Performance tracking and error monitoring

## Contents

1. **COMPLETE_DATA_REQUIREMENTS_MAP.md** - Comprehensive mapping of all component data requirements
2. **PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical architecture overview
3. **API_ENDPOINTS.md** - Complete API documentation
4. **KNOWN_ISSUES.md** - Detailed issue tracking and solutions
5. **TESTING_CHECKLIST.md** - Validation requirements

## Quick Start

The platform currently has:
- ✅ 630 authentic players with Round 13 AFL Fantasy data
- ✅ v3.4.4 projection algorithm working (displaying 109, 107, 111, 117, 124, 127 points)
- ✅ DVP matchup difficulty API returning correct values
- ✅ Complete fixture data for rounds 20-24
- ❌ Player modal difficulty colors showing incorrect values (main remaining issue)

## Core Data Files

The platform requires these critical files to function:
- `player_data_stats_enhanced_20250720_205845.json` (630 players)
- `attached_assets/DFS_DVP_Matchup_Tables_FIXED_1753016059835.xlsx` (DVP data)
- `attached_assets/afl_fixture_2025_1753111987231.json` (fixture schedule)

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Express.js + TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Python: Data processing and AI algorithms

## Current Status

**Working Components:**
- Dashboard with team summary
- Player statistics tables
- Projected score algorithm (v3.4.4)
- DVP analysis tools
- Cash generation tools
- Captain selection tools

**Remaining Issues:**
- Player modal fixture difficulty colors
- Some team code mapping inconsistencies
- Multi-position player handling

For any competent AI assistant, completing this project should take 1-2 hours focusing on the frontend data binding issues documented in the requirements map.
