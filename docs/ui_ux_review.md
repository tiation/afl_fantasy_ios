## Areas for Enhancement

### üö® High Priority

#### 1. Missing Quick Captain Change
**Issue**: Users can view captain suggestions but cannot set captain directly from suggestion cards
**Impact**: Increases friction in core user workflow
**Solution**: Add "Set as Captain" button to captain suggestion cards with confirmation dialog

#### 2. Trade Execution Flow
**Issue**: Calculator mode shows trade analysis but lacks actual player selection and execution
**Impact**: Breaks the complete trade workflow, reduces app utility
**Solution**: Implement player picker sheets and trade confirmation/execution flow
