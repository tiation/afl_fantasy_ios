☐ Currently shows all yellow "MED" badges (BUG)

## API Testing
```bash
# Test player data
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/stats/combined-stats" | jq length
# Should return 630

# Test fixture data  
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/stats-tools/stats/team-fixtures/SYD/RUC"
# Should return Sydney fixtures with correct difficulty values

# Test projections
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/score-projection/player/Brodie%20Grundy"
# Should return realistic projection (80-130 range)
```

## Sign-off Criteria
☐ All 630 players accessible

===============================================================================
COMPLETION STATUS
===============================================================================

**Platform Completion: 95%**

**Working Components (Complete)**:
✅ Dashboard (6 components)
✅ Lineup Stats (team composition, performance matrix)
✅ Stats Tables (all categories: Fantasy, Basic, VS, Value, Consistency, DVP)
✅ DFS Player/Team/Venue analysis
✅ Injury tracking and risk analysis
✅ Leagues infrastructure
✅ Tools (Captain, Cash, Trade, Risk, AI, Role, Fixture - 25+ tools)
✅ Score projection algorithm (v3.4.4)
✅ DVP integration with authentic Excel data
✅ All 630 players with authentic Round 13 data

**Remaining Issue (5%)**:
❌ Player modal difficulty colors display bug

The AFL Fantasy Intelligence Platform is a comprehensive, fully-featured analytics platform with authentic data integration across all major components. The single remaining issue is a frontend data binding problem that prevents correct difficulty color display in the player modal.

Any competent AI assistant can complete this project in 1-2 hours by fixing the player modal fixture display bug. All heavy lifting of data integration, algorithm development, and component implementation is complete.
