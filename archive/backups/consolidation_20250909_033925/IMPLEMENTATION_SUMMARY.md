   AFLFantasyDataService ← → KeychainManager
           ↓
    SwiftUI Views (Dashboard, Login, Settings)
```

### Security Model
- **No Plain Text Storage**: All sensitive data in iOS Keychain
- **Session Management**: Automatic credential clearing on logout
- **Secure Communication**: HTTPS-only API communication
- **Access Control**: Keychain access restricted to app bundle

### Performance Features
- **Concurrent Requests**: Multiple API calls executed simultaneously
- **Smart Caching**: 5-minute cache with automatic background refresh
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal data retention, automatic cleanup
- **Responsive UI**: Async/await pattern prevents UI blocking

## 🚀 Integration Ready

### Fully Functional Components
- ✅ **Authentication Flow**: Complete login/logout with credential storage
- ✅ **Data Synchronization**: Real-time updates with caching
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states with user feedback
- ✅ **Settings Management**: User preferences and account management
