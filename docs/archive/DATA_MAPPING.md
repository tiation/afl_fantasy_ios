const aflFantasyService = {
  // Ready for authentication tokens
  headers: {
    'Authorization': process.env.AFL_FANTASY_AUTH_TOKEN,
    'Cookie': process.env.AFL_FANTASY_SESSION_TOKEN
  },
  
  // Endpoints identified for your team data
  endpoints: {
    userTeam: '/api/classic/team',
    playerPrices: '/api/players',
    liveScores: '/api/scores/live'
  },
  
  // Data transformation ready
  transformTeamData: (rawData) => {
    // Convert AFL Fantasy format to app format
  }
}
```

## Next Steps for Complete Integration
